    "content=\"# Research Density Comparison: Chapter 5 vs Chapter 9\\n\\nI don't currently have access to your Scrivener research materials or Zotero database (the path is not configured in .env), so I cannot provide a direct quantitative comparison of research density between these chapters.\\n\\nHowever, based on the outline provided, I can offer some observations about what we might expect:\\n\\n## Chapter 5: Early Warning\\n**Expected research focus:**\\n- Real-time sensor networks and telecommunications infrastructure\\n- Wildfire detection and alert systems (LA fires, January 2025)\\n- Digital twin technology for smoke plume prediction (Austin, TX)\\n- Behavioral psychology: notification fatigue and risk perception\\n- Population migration patterns in hazard zones\\n\\n**Likely research types:** Technical documentation, case studies, behavioral science, sensor technology papers\\n\\n## Chapter 9: Underground Cables\\n**Expected research focus:**\\n- Utility infrastructure and grid resilience\\n- Computer simulation/modeling for infrastructure burial\\n- Cost-benefit analysis of undergrounding power lines\\n- Wildfire prevention through infrastructure hardening\\n- Urban design integration (bike paths + fiber optics + power)\\n\\n**Likely research types:** Infrastructure engineering, utility case studies, urban planning, simulation modeling\\n\\n---\\n\\n## To Conduct Actual Comparison\\n\\n**I recommend using the check-sync skill** to:\\n1. Verify which research sources are tagged to each chapter\\n2. Identify gaps between your outline and actual research collected\\n3. Quantify source count per chapter\\n4. Flag any missing research areas\\n\\nWould you like me to help you organize a research audit once your Scrivener/Zotero paths are configured?\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={} id='d5c01e3a-1630-42c6-9a5e-d48b02e6a850'"
